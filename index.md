### CPSC 120

*Lab 3 

 Lab 3, part one was one of my favorites because it taught me how to concatenate, as the assignment was to make a sandwich with a program. The user inputs their bread, protein,  and condiment of choice, and then the program makes everything into a sentence, to form the kind of sandwich the user wants. 


*Lab 7

 Lab 7 part one was one of my favorites because it required several uses of functions. At the time of this lab, I did not really understand functions and how to declare/ call them, but after this lab, the topic was more clear to me and showed me the importance of functions in programming. 

*Lab 10

 Lab 10, part one was one of my favorites as we calculated the area of a rectangle using functions and making sure that the area of any rectangle that has a negative length or width, its area is zero. In this lab, I learned how to use try catch to read the arguments of the user. This lab taught me how to use try catch and made me understand the concept of it.
